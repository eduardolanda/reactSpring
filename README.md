## Landing Page using React Spring .


### `What is it?`
This is a landing page to showcase projects using animation from the library REACT SPRING.

### `Tech used for this project`
React.Js
React-Spring


### `Why did I use this tech?`
I want to see if the speed and stability of animation of React Spring was useful to create projects and add animation and YES! This is fast and web responsive to multiple screens. 

### `REACT SPRING`
Their documentation is well presented but I would say, rushed.  
There are plenty ways to create projects and add animations using this library, a couple code of lines can make a huge difference. 

### `Do you want to run this project?`

Just donwload the project and run in using yarn start or npm start, after being installed.
